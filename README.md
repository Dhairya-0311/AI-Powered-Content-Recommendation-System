Here’s a **clear and beginner-friendly README description** for your GitHub repo that explains both the working and the process of your project.
I’ve kept it structured so anyone can understand what it does, why it’s useful, and how it works.

# 🎬 AI-Powered Content Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **machine learning recommendation system** built with **TensorFlow** that suggests similar shows/movies based on a given title.
It uses **embedding layers** to learn relationships between **content**, **language**, and **content type**, enabling it to recommend items that are most similar in the dataset.

Think of it like **Netflix's "Because you watched..." feature** — but built from scratch!

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Content-based recommendations**: Suggests similar titles based on features of the given content.
* **Multi-input neural network**: Takes in content ID, language, and type for better predictions.
* **Custom embeddings**: Learns numerical vector representations of content, making similarity searches possible.
* **Simple function call** to get top recommendations.
* **Data preprocessing** for cleaning, deduplication, and encoding categorical features.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python** – Data processing and model development
* **Pandas** – Dataset handling and preprocessing
* **NumPy** – Numeric operations
* **TensorFlow / Keras** – Model building and training

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains:

* **Title** – Name of the content
* **Hours Viewed** – Popularity measure
* **Language Indicator** – Original language of the content
* **Content Type** – Movie, TV Show, etc.

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**

* Removed missing and duplicate titles
* Assigned a unique `Content_ID` for each item
* Converted language and content type to numeric codes
* Cleaned numeric columns (removed commas, converted to integers)

### **2️⃣ Model Architecture**

* **Inputs**:

  * `content_id` (Content unique ID)
  * `language_id` (Language code)
  * `content_type` (Movie / Series code)

* **Embeddings**:

  * Content → 32-dimensional vector
  * Language → 8-dimensional vector
  * Type → 4-dimensional vector

* **Dense Layers**:

  * Two hidden layers (64 and 32 neurons) with ReLU activation
  * Final layer uses Softmax to predict probabilities for each content ID

### **3️⃣ Training**

* Loss function: **Sparse Categorical Crossentropy**
* Optimizer: **Adam**
* Trained for multiple epochs in mini-batches

### **4️⃣ Recommendation Function**

```python
recommend_similar("Wednesday", top_k=5)
```

* Finds the content in the dataset
* Passes its IDs into the model
* Returns the top `k` most similar titles (excluding the given one)

---

## 📊 Example Output

If you run:

```python
recommend_similar("Wednesday")
```

You might get:

| Title                   | Language Indicator | Content Type | Hours Viewed |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Stranger Things         | English            | TV Show      | 123,000,000  |
| The Chilling Adventures | English            | TV Show      | 95,000,000   |
| ...                     | ...                | ...          | ...          |

---

## 💡 How It Works

The model learns **relationships** between items in the dataset using **embeddings**.
Items with similar embeddings are likely to be related in content, genre, or audience preference — allowing the model to recommend them.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Include **user interaction data** for personalized recommendations
* Add **genre and release year** as features
* Use **cosine similarity** for faster recommendation lookups
* Deploy as a **Flask/Django web app** with an interactive search bar
